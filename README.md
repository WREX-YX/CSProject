##### Above Graphic: In-Game Testing. 
### This project went relatively well, the only issue that had occured was issues with the snake's path always being one-off and the snake sometimes being stagnant. These problems were fixed during a trial and error phase. If I had to do this again I would try to reduce the methods and use a recursive process. If I continue this porject, I would add different difficulties that have to do with MoveSpeed and an option to turn borders on and off. I would also like to add a leaderboard in the future.
